# Matrix Programs in C

This repository contains various matrix-related programs written in C.
The purpose of this project is to practice and understand matrix operations
using arrays, loops, and logic building.

## Programs Included
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Transpose
- Wave Print of Matrix
- Spiral Print of Matrix
- Row-wise and Column-wise traversal

## Concepts Used
- 2D Arrays
- Nested Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Functions
- Input/Output in C

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   gcc filename.c
2. Run the executable:
   ./a.out

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Matrix traversal techniques
- Logical thinking using loops
- Handling 2D data in C
